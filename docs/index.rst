`Apologies <https://pypi.org/project/apologies/>`_ is a Python library that
implements a game similar to the Sorry board game.  It includes a rudimentary
way to play the game, intended for use by developers and not by end users.

*Note:* This is alpha-quality code that is still under active development.
Interfaces may change without warning until the design stabilizes.
